# Core Tracking Thresholds - OPTIMIZED FOR HIGH SENSITIVITY
track_high_thresh: 0.35  # Lower to keep weak detections (was 0.5)
track_low_thresh: 0.15   # Allow recovery of weak detections (was 0.1)
new_track_thresh: 0.4    # Match detection confidence threshold (was 0.6)
track_buffer: 60         # Keep tracks for 2 seconds during occlusion (was 30)
match_thresh: 0.8        # IoU matching threshold
fuse_score: True         # Fuse detection score with IoU for better matching
